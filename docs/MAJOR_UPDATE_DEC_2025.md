# Healthcare Admin Jobs - MAJOR UPDATE (December 26, 2025)

## 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH: Relaxed Education Filter Implementation

### Problem Solved
Our previous strict education filter was **TOO RESTRICTIVE**, filtering out 54.6% of jobs and leaving us with only **13 jobs nationwide** from 1,504 analyzed jobs.

### Solution Implemented
**NEW RELAXED EDUCATION FILTER** that includes broader entry-level opportunities while maintaining quality standards.

### Results Achieved
- **32x IMPROVEMENT**: From **13 jobs** → **417 jobs** 
- **Inclusion Rate**: From **0.9%** → **27.7%**
- **Geographic Coverage**: **26 states** across all US regions
- **Education Filter Impact**: From **54.6%** rejected → **1.8%** rejected

## New Filtering Approach

### ✅ INCLUDED POSITIONS
- High school diploma + relevant experience
- Associates degree positions
- Certificate/diploma programs  
- Bachelor's degree required OR preferred
- No specific education requirements (experience-based)

### ❌ EXCLUDED POSITIONS (Only These)
- Master's degree or higher required
- Senior executive positions (CEO, VP, etc.)
- Positions requiring 10+ years experience

## Updated Statistics

## Files Updated

- `hc_jobs_pipeline/README.md` - Updated pipeline docs

## Impact
This change transforms the system from a **highly selective** bachelor's-only tool to a **comprehensive healthcare admin job platform** that serves entry-level candidates across all education levels while maintaining focus on administrative (non-clinical) roles.

The 32x improvement proves that **education filtering was the primary bottleneck**, not geographic coverage or employer database size.
